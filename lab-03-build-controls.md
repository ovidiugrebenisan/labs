# Lab 3: Build Controls and Attestations

## Learning Goals

- Understand what attestations are and why they matter for compliance
- Attest artifacts (binaries and Docker images) to Kosli
- Attach test results (JUnit) as attestations
- Attach Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) as attestations
- Understand how attestations provide evidence in your software supply chain
- Integrate attestation commands into your CI/CD pipeline

## Introduction

**Attestations** are how you record facts about your software supply chain in Kosli. They are immutable pieces of evidence that prove certain activities occurred - like tests passing, security scans completing, or artifacts being built.

In Kosli, you can attest:
- **Artifacts**: The binaries or container images you build (establishing provenance)
- **Test results**: JUnit tests, coverage reports, etc.
- **Security scans**: SBOM, vulnerability scans (Snyk, Trivy, etc.)
- **Pull requests**: Verification that code was reviewed
- **Custom evidence**: Any other facts you want to record

Each attestation is linked to a Trail and optionally to a specific artifact. This creates an auditable chain of evidence showing what happened during your software delivery process.

## Prerequisites

- Completed [Lab 2: Flows and Trails](lab-02-flows-and-trails.md)
- Kosli CLI installed and configured
- Your forked kosli-tryout repository with Flow and Trail creation working
- Understanding of your application's build process

## Exercise

### Overview

In this lab, you will:

- Attest the Java application artifact (JAR file) to Kosli
- Attest the Docker container image to Kosli
- Attach JUnit test results as attestations
- Generate and attest an SBOM (Software Bill of Materials)
- Create shell scripts to integrate attestations into your workflow
- View all attestations in the Kosli web interface

### Step-by-step instructions

#### Understanding artifact fingerprints

Kosli identifies artifacts by their SHA256 fingerprint (hash). This fingerprint uniquely identifies the artifact regardless of where it's stored or what it's named. The Kosli CLI can automatically calculate fingerprints for:

- **Files**: JAR files, binaries, etc. (`--artifact-type file`)
- **Directories**: Source code, build outputs (`--artifact-type dir`)
- **Docker images**: From local Docker daemon (`--artifact-type docker`)
- **OCI images**: From container registries (`--artifact-type oci`)

> :bulb: Using fingerprints ensures you're tracking the exact artifact, not just its name or tag.

See [Artifacts documentation](https://docs.kosli.com/getting_started/artifacts/) for more details.

#### Attest the application artifact

Your build process creates a JAR file in `app/build/libs/`. Let's attest it:

**Create `ci/attest-app.sh`:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e

echo "Attesting application artifact..."

# Find the JAR file
JAR_FILE=$(ls app/build/libs/app-*-all.jar)

kosli attest artifact ${JAR_FILE} \
  --artifact-type file \
  --flow ${APP_NAME}-pipeline \
  --trail ${GIT_COMMIT} \
  --name application \
  --build-url ${BUILD_URL} \
  --commit-url ${COMMIT_URL}

echo "Application artifact attested successfully"
```

Make it executable:

```bash
chmod +x ci/attest-app.sh
```

The `--name application` parameter gives this artifact a logical name in your Flow. This name will be used to attach other attestations (like tests) to this specific artifact.

See [kosli attest artifact](https://docs.kosli.com/client_reference/kosli_attest_artifact/) for more details.

#### Attest JUnit test results

Your pipeline runs tests that produce JUnit XML results. Let's attest them:

**Create `ci/attest-junit.sh`:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e

echo "Attesting JUnit test results..."

# Find the JUnit test results
JUNIT_RESULTS="app/build/test-results/test/*.xml"

kosli attest junit \
  --flow ${APP_NAME}-pipeline \
  --trail ${GIT_COMMIT} \
  --name application.unit-tests \
  --results-dir app/build/test-results/test/

echo "JUnit test results attested successfully"
```

Make it executable:

```bash
chmod +x ci/attest-junit.sh
```

The `--name application.unit-tests` links this attestation to the `application` artifact we attested earlier. Kosli automatically analyzes the JUnit XML to determine if tests passed or failed.

> :bulb: The dot notation (artifact.attestation) tells Kosli this attestation belongs to a specific artifact. Attestations without dots belong to the Trail itself.

See [kosli attest junit](https://docs.kosli.com/client_reference/kosli_attest_junit/) for more details.

#### Attest the Docker image

After building the Docker image, attest it to Kosli:

**Create `ci/attest-docker.sh`:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e

echo "Attesting Docker image..."

IMAGE_NAME="ghcr.io/${IMAGE}:latest"

kosli attest artifact ${IMAGE_NAME} \
  --artifact-type oci \
  --flow ${APP_NAME}-pipeline \
  --trail ${GIT_COMMIT} \
  --name docker-image \
  --build-url ${BUILD_URL} \
  --commit-url ${COMMIT_URL}

echo "Docker image attested successfully"
```

Make it executable:

```bash
chmod +x ci/attest-docker.sh
```

Using `--artifact-type oci` tells Kosli to fetch the image manifest directly from the container registry without needing Docker locally. This is more reliable in CI environments.

> :bulb: You can attest both the JAR and Docker image, or just the Docker image. Both approaches are valid - it depends on what you consider your deployable artifact.

#### Generate and attest SBOM

Your workflow already generates an SBOM using Anchore. Let's attest it:

**Create `ci/attest-sbom.sh`:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e

echo "Attesting SBOM..."

IMAGE_NAME="ghcr.io/${IMAGE}:latest"

kosli attest sbom \
  --flow ${APP_NAME}-pipeline \
  --trail ${GIT_COMMIT} \
  --name docker-image.sbom \
  --artifact-type oci ${IMAGE_NAME} \
  --sbom sbom.spdx.json

echo "SBOM attested successfully"
```

Make it executable:

```bash
chmod +x ci/attest-sbom.sh
```

The SBOM attestation is linked to the `docker-image` artifact. Kosli stores the SBOM in its Evidence Vault for future reference.

> :bulb: An SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) lists all components and dependencies in your software. It's crucial for tracking vulnerabilities and license compliance.

See [kosli attest sbom](https://docs.kosli.com/client_reference/kosli_attest_sbom/) for more details and [Attestations documentation](https://docs.kosli.com/getting_started/attestations/) for conceptual understanding.

#### Verify the workflow integration

Your `.github/workflows/full-pipeline.yaml` already references these scripts. The steps should be:

```yaml
- name: Kosli attest application
  run: ci/attest-app.sh
  env:
    KOSLI_API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.KOSLI_API_TOKEN }}
    KOSLI_ORG: ${{ secrets.KOSLI_ORG }}

- name: attest junit tests
  run: ci/attest-junit.sh
  env:
    KOSLI_API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.KOSLI_API_TOKEN }}
    KOSLI_ORG: ${{ secrets.KOSLI_ORG }}
```

And in the Docker-image job:

```yaml
- name: Attest docker image
  run: bash ci/attest-docker.sh
  env:
    KOSLI_API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.KOSLI_API_TOKEN }}
    KOSLI_ORG: ${{ secrets.KOSLI_ORG }}

- name: Attest SBOM
  run: bash ci/attest-sbom.sh
  env:
    KOSLI_API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.KOSLI_API_TOKEN }}
    KOSLI_ORG: ${{ secrets.KOSLI_ORG }}
```

#### Test the attestations

1. Commit the attestation scripts:

```bash
git add ci/attest-app.sh ci/attest-junit.sh ci/attest-docker.sh ci/attest-sbom.sh
git commit -m "Add Kosli attestation scripts"
git push origin main
```

2. Watch the GitHub Actions workflow run
3. Verify each attestation step completes successfully
4. Check the logs for Kosli CLI output showing fingerprints and attestation confirmations

#### View attestations in Kosli

1. Log in to [app.kosli.com](https://app.kosli.com)
2. Navigate to your Flow (kosli-tryout-pipeline)
3. Click on the latest Trail (your commit SHA)
4. You should see:
   - **Artifacts**: The JAR file and Docker image with their fingerprints
   - **Attestations**: Unit tests, SBOM attached to artifacts
   - **Timeline**: When each attestation was recorded
5. Click on individual attestations to view details:
   - JUnit results showing test counts and any failures
   - SBOM showing dependencies and components
   - Links to build URLs and commit URLs

> :bulb: The Trail view provides a complete audit trail of everything that happened for this commit, with immutable evidence stored in Kosli.

#### Optional: Attest vulnerability scans

Your workflow already runs Trivy security scans. While not creating an attestation yet, you could extend this lab by attesting the scan results:

```bash
# Example for future enhancement
kosli attest generic \
  --flow ${APP_NAME}-pipeline \
  --trail ${GIT_COMMIT} \
  --name docker-image.security-scan \
  --artifact-type oci ghcr.io/${IMAGE}:latest \
  --compliant true \
  --description "Trivy scan completed"
```

> :bulb: Generic attestations allow you to record any fact. In production, you'd parse the Trivy results and set `--compliant` based on severity thresholds.

</details>

### Verification Checklist

Before moving to the next lab, ensure you have:

- ✅ Created attestation scripts: `attest-app.sh`, `attest-junit.sh`, `attest-docker.sh`, `attest-sbom.sh`
- ✅ All scripts are executable and integrated into the workflow
- ✅ Workflow runs successfully with all attestation steps passing
- ✅ Can see artifacts in the Kosli Trail view with their fingerprints
- ✅ Can see JUnit test results attached to the application artifact
- ✅ Can see SBOM attached to the Docker image artifact
- ✅ Understand how attestations create an audit trail

### Clean up

No cleanup is required. Attestations are immutable records that remain for audit purposes.

## Next Steps

In [Lab 5: Runtime Controls](lab-05-runtime-controls.md), you'll learn how to create environments, snapshot what's running in production, and enforce compliance policies.
